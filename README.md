# aai-500-final-group-4
Project Completed: June 26 2023

## Project Objective 
Our purpose was to better understand the volatile housing market by using public income and housing data. By filtering and combining features/inputs we predicted to create a better model to predict housing value in a given region. We also wanted to visualize our final datasets and run them through a variety of models to compare performance. If a general price prediction solution can be developed, it can then be tailored to a specific region or market to match business needs

## Models Tested and Illustrated
* Gaussian 
* Gamma 			
* Neural Network 	
* XGBoost 

### Data sets needed
